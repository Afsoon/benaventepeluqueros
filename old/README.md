# Benavente Peluqueros
Website create during the lockdown, a few weeks before of reopening of hairdresser. This project had the following phase:

The first phase to allow the customer to register in the waiting list until the governement communicate the day the shops can open again. This way we can after call our customer and save a date for them.

The second phase to allow customer to book an appointment but with the restriction of people allowed at same time in the local.

The third phase, and under development right now, to integrate this website with my current final project of grade of the university. The goal is to allow our customer select multiple services to book, and in real time, and sync the data with the admin dashboard of the shop.

Developed with ❤️ by Said.
